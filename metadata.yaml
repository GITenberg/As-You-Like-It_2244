description: Rosalind, daughter of the deposed Duke Senior, is exiled from the court
  by her wicked uncle. Disguising herself as a young man and accompanied by her cousin
  Celia and their loyal fool Touchstone, she takes refuge in the Forest of Arden.
  In the forest Rosalind meets young Orlando with whom she is in love, but her male
  disguise complicates matters, especially when Rosalind finds she has unwittingly
  attracted the shepherdess Phebe. --From publisher's description.
